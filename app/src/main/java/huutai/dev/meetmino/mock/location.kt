The rice paper is evenly coated with ingredients such as eggs, scallion oil, spices, fish cake, dried shrimp, dried squid, fried shallots, and other seasonings. Some people even add a layer of cheese on top of the rice paper to create a delicious, aromatic cheesy flavor. Once the rice paper is prepared and the seasonings are added, it is grilled over charcoal or a wood-fired stove. The bánh tráng is grilled until it becomes slightly crispy and develops an attractive golden brown color. The grilling process creates a crispy outer shell and a soft, smooth inner layer, resulting in a delightful combination of ingredients and flavors. With its fantastic taste and simple preparation, bánh tráng nướng has become an important part of Vietnamese cuisine. It is a beloved street food that can be found in various street stalls and is cherished for its unique texture and flavors.",
